## Background
West Nile virus (WNV) is an infectious viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, which can lead to flu-like symptoms, neurological complications, and potentially fatal illnesses in humans.

In the year 2002, the initial human cases of West Nile virus were reported in the city of Chicago. Subsequently, the City of Chicago and the **Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)** took significant measures to establish a comprehensive surveillance and control program. This program has been diligently maintained and remains in operation to this day. Over the course of 12 years, substantial efforts have been invested in combating the spread of West Nile Virus, resulting in the accumulation of a vast amount of data by the **CDPH**. This rich dataset now serves as a valuable resource for making evidence-based decisions.

## Problem Statement
We, **Data Nine-Nine**, have been engaged as a third-party consulting firm by the **Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** to collaborate on a comprehensive review of their West Nile virus (WNV) control efforts. Our objective is to

	(1) build machine learning model to predict the presence of WNV; 

	(2) providing valuable insights and recommendations to further enhance their strategies 
<br>

in combatting the West Nile virus outbreak.

<br>

## Project Deliverables
Our project is centered around the following objectives:

1. Conduct comprehensive **research** on the occurrence and prevalence of the West Nile virus in the city of Chicago.
2. Develop and **train a machine learning model** capable of accurately predicting the probability of the presence of the West Nile virus.
3. Share our **insights and recommendations** with the esteemed members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including biostatisticians and epidemiologists.
4. Provide a thorough **cost-benefit analysis** to support the CDC members in making informed decisions based on data-driven recommendations for the future.

## Datasets:
Public health workers in Chicago setup mosquito traps scattered across the city. The captured mosquitos are tested for the presence of West Nile virus.

* [`train.csv`](../assets/train.csv): The "train.csv" dataset comprises information regarding the geographical coordinates of mosquito traps, the count of mosquitos captured in each trap, and the presence or absence of the West Nile Virus. The dataset encompasses data collected during the years 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013.

## Data Preprocessing
![Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/khammingfatt/project-4-data-backed-solutions-for-combating-wnv-in-chicago/blob/main/images/Data%20Preprocessing.jpg?raw=true)

We followed a rigorous data preprocessing pipeline consisting of three key steps. Firstly, we employed the **One Hot Encoder** technique to convert categorical data into **numerical format**, ensuring compatibility with our models. This transformation allowed us to effectively capture the information contained within the categorical variables.

Next, we applied the **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** to balance the target class distribution, aiming for a **50:50 ratio**. By oversampling the minority class, we addressed the issue of class imbalance and improved the performance of our models in handling the target variable.

In the final step of data preprocessing, we utilized the **Standard Scaler** method. This process involved transforming all features within the dataset to a **similar scale and distribution**. By doing so, we minimized the potential impact of varying feature magnitudes, allowing our models to better understand the relative importance of different features during the classification process.

## Modeling

![Modeling](https://github.com/khammingfatt/project-4-data-backed-solutions-for-combating-wnv-in-chicago/blob/main/images/Model%20Workflow.jpg?raw=true)

Following the data preprocessing stage, the preprocessed dataset was fed into a pipeline of five classification models: **logistic regression, random forest classifier, XGBoost, Adaboost, and Voting Classifier**. These models were carefully chosen based on their respective strengths and suitability for the classification task at hand. The use of multiple models allowed us to leverage their individual capabilities and ensemble them to make more robust predictions.

By employing this systematic approach, we aimed to enhance the quality and reliability of our classification results, enabling us to make informed decisions based on the predictions generated by the ensemble of models.
